# Applying PCA on MNIST Dataset and carry out classification using  Decision Tree.

### Dimensionality Reduction and PCA for Handwritten dataset of MNIST
Principal Components Analysis is the simplest example of dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality 
reduction is the problem of taking a matrix with many observations, and "compressing it" to a matrix with 
fewer observations which preserves as much of the information in the full matrix as possible.

We obsevrved there is increase in accuracy after using pca on mnist dataset.
